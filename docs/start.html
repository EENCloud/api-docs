<p>
    Most of this API's services require a valid session to use, which you can acquire by first calling <a href="#" id="show_authenticate">aaa/authenticate</a>, followed by <a href="#" id="show_authorize">aaa/authorize</a>, which results in receiving a "videobank_sessionid" cookie. For all subsequent API calls, you can either send that cookie or send the value of the cookie as the "A" parameter.

    API service URLs have a base URL of "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/g/" (e.g. "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/g/list/devices"), unless otherwise noted. The specific API sections that have a different base url are Asset, Poll, and Pngspan. (e.g. Asset "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/asset/asset/image.jpeg", Poll "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/poll", Pngspan "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/pngspan/{png_type}.png").

    Most of this API's services require a valid session to use, which you can acquire by first calling <a href="#" id="show_authenticate">aaa/authenticate</a> and <a href="#" id="show_authorize">aaa/authorize</a>.

    Most API service URLs have a base URL of "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/g/" (e.g. "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/g/list/devices"), unless otherwise noted (e.g. Asset "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/asset/asset/image.jpeg", Poll "https://eagleeyenetworks.com/poll").

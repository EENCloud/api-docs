    Gaining access to the EEVBS is a two-stage process:  Clients first present their credentials and Realm to obtain a single use Authentication Token. This single use token is valid for 30 seconds or until it has been used.  Once the Authentication Token is obtained the Client must utilize it in an Authorize service call to obtain a Cookie that provides access to resources.  This two phase approach allows Clients to authenticate and operate in multiple domains.  The first step is done using Authenticate.  The second step is done using Authorize.  Note that the Authenticate call must be done over an https connection.  All status codes are listed in order of precedence, meaning the first one listed is the one returned if its respective conditions are met, and the last one listed is the one that will be returned if none of the preceding codes' conditions are met.

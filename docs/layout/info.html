    Layouts contain groups of cameras arranged for viewing on screen.  Layouts can be created for both mobile and desktop browsers.  Layouts are associated with an account and account users are granted view/write/share permissions for the layout.  Users who would otherwise have no access to a cameras, gain access to all cameras included in layouts shared with them.

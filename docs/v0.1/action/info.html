    This service defines several macro actions that can be attached  to devices.  These are convenience functions.  The same functionality provided herein can also be accomplished via individual setting calls.  Most actions can be scheduled to occur now or at some point in the future.

    Given the macro nature and the number of devices and operations that may occur, so long as the arguments are correct, the services will return success status code.  The application should  monitor the vent stream to determine success of failure of the action on a device by device basis.
